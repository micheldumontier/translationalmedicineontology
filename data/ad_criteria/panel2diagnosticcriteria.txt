Probable AD: A plus one or more supportive features B, C, D, or E 
Core diagnostic criteria 
A. Presence of an early and significant episodic memory impairment that includes the 
following features: 
 1. Gradual and progressive change in memory function reported by patients or 
informants over more than 6 months 
 2. Objective evidence of signifcantly impaired episodic memory on testing: this 
generally consists of recall deficit that does not improve significantly or does not 
normalise with cueing or recognition testing and after effective encoding of 
information has been previously controlled 
 3. The episodic memory impairment can be isolated or associated with other cognitive 
changes at the onset of AD or as AD advances 
Supportive features 
B. Presence of medial temporal lobe atrophy 
•  Volume loss of hippocampi, entorhinal cortex, amygdala evidenced on MRI with 
qualitative ratings using visual scoring (referenced to well characterised population 
with age norms) or quantitative volumetry of regions of interest (referenced to well 
characterised population with age norms) 
C. Abnormal cerebrospinal fluid biomarker 
•  Low amyloid ß1–42 concentrations, increased total tau concentrations, or increased 
phospho-tau concentrations, or combinations of the three 
•  Other well validated markers to be discovered in the future 
D. Specific pattern on functional neuroimaging with PET 
•  Reduced glucose metabolism in bilateral temporal parietal regions 
•  Other well validated ligands, including those that foreseeably will emerge such as 
Pittsburg compound B or FDDNP 
E. Proven AD autosomal dominant mutation within the immediate family 
Exclusion criteria 
History 
•  Sudden onset 
•  Early occurrence of the following symptoms: gait disturbances, seizures, 
behavioural changes 
Clinical features 
•  Focal neurological features including hemiparesis, sensory loss, visual field 
deficits 
•  Early extrapyramidal signs 
Other medical disorders severe enough to account for memory and related symptoms 
•  Non-AD dementia 
•  Major depression 
•  Cerebrovascular disease 
•  Toxic and metabolic abnormalities, all of which may require specific 
investigations 
•  MRI FLAIR or T2 signal abnormalities in the medial temporal lobe that are 
consistent with infectious or vascular insults 
Criteria for definite AD 
AD is considered definite if the following are present: 
• Both clinical and histopathological (brain biopsy or autopsy) evidence of the 
disease, as required by the NIA-Reagan criteria for the post-mortem diagnosis of 
AD; criteria must both be present139 
•  Both clinical and genetic evidence (mutation on chromosome 1, 14, or 21) of AD; 
criteria must both be present
