* Comments on ontology in general
  -------------------------------

** label
Should not contain spaces; replace ' ' by '_' to get standard display?

** DbXref
Are recorded in the format <ID_space>:<ID>
where:
 ID_Space  source
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ACGT	   Cancer Research and Management ACGT Master Ontology
 BIRNLex   BIRNLex
 BRO       Biomedical research Ontology
 CHEBI	   Chemical Entities of Biological Interest
 CPR	   Computer-based Patient Record Ontology
 DOID	   Human Disease Ontology
 EFO	   Experimental Factor Ontology
 FHHO	   Family Health History Ontology
 FMA	   Foundational Model of Anatomy
 GO	   Gene Ontology
 GRO	   Gene Regulation Ontology
 Galen	   Galen
 HL7V3.0   HL7 Version 3.0
 IEV	   Event (INOH Pathway Ontology) 
 LNC	   Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes
 MI	   Protein-protein Interaction Ontology
 MSH	   Medical Subject Headings
 NCIt	   NCI Thesaurus 
 NDFRT	   National Drug File
 OBI	   Ontology for Biomedical Investigations
 OCRe	   Ontology for Clinical Research
 ODGI	   Ontology for Disease Genetic Investigation
 PATO	   Phenotypic Quality Ontology
 PRO	   PRotein Ontology
 SNOMEDCT  SNOMED Clinical Terms
 SO	   Sequence Ontology
 UMLS	   Unified Medical Language System

Are found in the following way:
 - take spreadsheet external reference IDs
 - query NCBO BioPortal
     if possible Exact Match search
     if not found Contains search
     hand pick IDs for sources which seem relevant
 - look up terms in UMLS
     get UMLS CUIs (supercedes UMLS CUIs found in BioPortal)
     add IDs for relevant sources (supercedes BioPortal IDs)



* comments on specific ontology classes
  -------------------------------------

** adverse_drug_event
Can this be covered by (drug_)toxicity?

** arm_of_clinical_study
Can this be put in relationship with clinical_study? Replace by
clinical_study_arm?
See also comments on subset_of_population.

** clinical_protocol
How does this compare to / could it be replaced by "Study Protocol"
(UMLS:C2348563)?

** clinical_study
Missing. Put under planned_process or under study? Is clinical_trial taking
care of that?

** clinical_trial_protocol
isA clinical_protocol, right?

** compound
Missing.

** cost
Missing.

** copy_number_variation
Why isA information_content_entity?
Only multi-word label with underscore instead of spaces. See comment above
on labels. Preferably change all other label spaces to underscores.
Consider also replacing this with either copy_number or
copy_number_polymorphism, two terms from NCIt:
 - NCIt:Copy_Number
   UMLS:C1707513
   Definition: NCIt: The number of molecules of a particular type on or in
   a cell or part of a cell. Usually applied to specific genes or to
   plasmids within a bacterium.
 - NCIt:Copy_Number_Polymorphism
   UMLS:C1511518
   Definition: NCIt: Variation in the number of copies of a particular
   sequence within the genetic material of an individual. Large-scale copy
   number polymorphisms are common and widely distributed in the human
   genome. 

** diagnosis_result
The result of diagnosis_process, right? That should be in definition.

** diagnosis_process
Checked this in a number of definitions invarious sources. diagnosis is
always understood to be the process of detecting or classifying a disease
or condition. Replace by diagnosis? If we agree on that, then all the found
xrefs (for diagnosis) are OK.

** disease

** disease_course
Replace by more common concept disease_progression. Then found xrefs (for
disease_progression) are OK.

** dosage
Assume that dose is a synonym, at least most of the time.

** drug_interaction
Missing. We only have drug_drug_interaction. Is this enough? Isn't
drug_(target_)interaction important too?

** environment
Missing. Only have environmental_measure. Are we fine with that. Not all
environments are / can be described by environmental measure.

** evidence
Missing. See also comments on piece_of_evidence.

** hypothesis
Is not a role.

** image
Why does this have an xref OBI:IAO_0000313 but is not defined by IAO?

** institution
Why isA dependent_continuant? Shouldn't it be an independent_continuant?
[I'm getting confused.]

** lifestyle
Missing, but I'm not really missing that one. Can be covered by evidence
and medical_history.

** medical_history
If medical_history is defined this way, then we are talking about
personal_medical_history, which is sometimes distinguished from
family_medical_history. Then all the found xrefs (for
(personal_)medical_history) are OK.

** mode_of_action

Replace by mechanism_of_action? Or accept found xrefs (for
mechanism_of_action).

molecular_entity
Why is molecule not enough? I think, I kind of know the answer - this is a bag
of things (atom, ion, molecule, ...). 

** observation
Missing, but I'm not missing that one either. And evidence should cover it.

** outcome
Missing, and not missed.

** patient
Missing class.

** payer
Why isA institution?

** phenotype
Missing. And that one I miss.

** piece_of_evidence
Replace by evidence_piece? But is this really necessary? evidence alone is
sufficient. Then all found xrefs (for evidence) are OK. Levels of evidence
can still be assessed with 'evidence'. E.g.: some evidence might suggest a
disease A, some evidence might suggest not-A; level of evidence can be
established by considering all evidence.

** prognosis
Is not a role.

** safety
Missing. And that one is hard to treat ontologically. As a research area
it's out of scope. As drug_safety or patient_safety it's still
vague. Aargh.

** side_effect
Missing; add? Don't quite like "process participated in by patient".
Also don't like all of my (NCIt's)  original definition. It really is any
(positive/negative, known/unknown) effect that a drug has, apart from the
intended effect, that it was approved for initially. Clearly this is
important.
NCIt:Side_Effect

** sign
Note, UMLS maps this to "Physical findings" (UMLS:C0311392).
 
** SNP
Why isA information_content_entity? Why not a sequence?
Can also be a sequence type or feature in SO.
Definition: NCIt: A variation of a single nucleotide at a specific location
of the genome due to base substitution, present at an appreciable frequency
between individuals of a single interbreeding population.

** subset_of_population
Why is this a class instead of restricting the population class by certain
criteria?
Wouldn't population be enough? Same argument as for piece_of_evidence. If
necessary to keep as such, rename to population_subset.
Also compare to NCIt:(Clinical_)Study_Population_Subgroup
((UMLS:C2347789)UMLS:C2348562).

** syndrome
Missing.
ACGT:Syndrome
DOID:225
EFO:0000716
MSH:D013577
NCIt:Syndrome
NDFRT:C5928
UMLS:C0039082
